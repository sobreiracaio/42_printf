# 42_printf

This project is a recreation of the printf function from the C standard library (stdio.h). The goal is to develop a customized version of this function, called ft_printf, which replicates the behavior and functionality of printf, but without using any external functions beyond the permitted ones (such as write). This requires directly handling string formatting, variable argument manipulation, and direct writing to stdout.
